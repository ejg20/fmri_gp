% gpgrid_dn()
%
% Fast version of GP prediction ALL points lie on a grid (with G grid points per dim).
% This version also attempts to do everything in linear memory complexity.
% gpgrid_img_dn does not consider spherical noise as a hyperparameter to be learned,
% but as input dependent noise specified by the user.
%
%
% Usage: [hypers_learned, Iout, Vout] = gpgrid_dn(input, Xgrid, noise, xstar, InitParamSet, cov, hyps_in_dim)
%        [hypers_learned] = gpgrid_dn(input, Xgrid, noise, xstar, InitParamSet, cov, hyps_in_dim)
%
% Inputs:
%     input         Input structure for GP-grid    
%       .index_to_N	Indices of not dummy locations
%       .data       The sub image to be interpolated
%     Xgrid         Cell array of per dimension grid points
%     noise_struct
%       .learn      flag if to learn noise hyperparameter
%       .var        noise variance of observations. If is a vector and
%                   noise_struct.learn == 1, then will only learn the noise
%                   for not dummy locations. if noise_struct.learn == 0,
%                   then noise_struct.var contains the known noise
%                   variance.
%       .sphericalNoise
%                   learn a single noise hyperparameter for entire input 
%                   space (spherical noise).
%     mask          Binary mask for output image
%     InitParamSet  Values of initial parameters. 
%       .learn      If true, then use initial values to find optimal hypers.
%                   If false, then use the first row of .vals as the
%                   optimal parameters (no learning).
%       .vals       Matrix where each row
%                   is an initial guess for all hypers. If learning noise 
%                   hyperparameter, then the noise hyperparameter must be
%                   located a the end of the hyperparameter vals vector
%     cov           Covariance function as in gpml-matlab
%     hyps_in_dim   A cell vector [size D]. Each cell contains a vector of
%                   the hyperparameters in the corresponding dimension. The
%                   parameters must be in the order to be used in the 
%                   covariance function.
%
% Outputs:
%     hypers_learned  learned hyperparameters
%     Iout              interpolated Image
%     Vout              GP variance (not implemented)
%
%
% Note:
% To use the package you must first install gpml-matlab.
% The package can be found in www.gaussianprocess.org/gpml/. The last
% version tested was gpml-matlab-v3.1-2010-09-27
